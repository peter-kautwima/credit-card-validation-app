## Why I built it the way I did

    I chose to build my app from scratch as a learning opportunity,
    the validation on the forms was rather tricky and have a new found appreciation for Formik.
    Since modals can be tricky and time was not on my side, I chose to use HeadlessUI for my modal, which I styled and added funcatinlity to.

## To Do & Notable Bugs

    1. Can currently ban the same country multiple times.
    2. Currently the Credit Card validation is hard coded to the year 2023
    3. Add Cypress and snapshot tests.
