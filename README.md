## Why I built it the way I did

    I chose to build my app from scratch as a learning opportunity,
    the validation on the forms was rather tricky and have a new found appreciation for Formik.
    Since modals can be tricky and time was not on my side, I chose to use HeadlessUI for my modal, which I styled and added funcatinlity to.

## To Do & Notable Bugs

    1. Add Banned Countries validation to form.
    2. Disable adding a Banned Country on the CreditCardForm to the CreditCardTable on the initial render.
    3. Can currently ban the same country multiple times.
    4. Credit Card validation is hard coded to the year 2023.
